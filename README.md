# Saturday Evening Studyin'

Awarded Best Game for Battle of the Code Clashers Challenge by Pinnguaq + The Hub!

## Inspiration
Other educational games like [OhMyGit](https://ohmygit.org/).

Some gameplay aspects of a popular rhythm game: Friday Night Funkin'
## What it does
Players will be able to select a topic to battle in and enter a pop-quiz style battle where getting correct answers attacks your opponent and getting incorrect ones allow the opponent to attack you.

Ideally, the game would have fun animations and visual cues to show the user was correct or not, these effects mainly in seeing the player attack the enemy or vice versa if the answer was incorrect.

## How we built it
Using the Unity game engine.

## Challenges we ran into
Team members we're quite busy over the weekend, and a lack of knowledge in Unity.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The main gameplay mechanic is mostly refined, and we were able to complete it in essentially a day's work with 2 people.

## What we learned
Some unique Unity mechanics and planning is key to put out a project this quickly.

## What's next for Saturday Evening Studyin'
Adding the other question types specified in our design (listed in the README.md), adding animations to the actual battle, adding character dialogue and depth.

One of the original ideas that were too complex to implement in this short amount of time is for 2 human players to battle each other, where the battle is turn-based and players can select the difficulty of question to determine the damage they can deal, with some questions having a margin of error for partial correctness to deal a fraction of the normal amount.
